Step 1: Set up Prerequisites (make sure you have jdk 1.8 or more)
=================================================================
AWS account, AWS Identity and Access Management(IAM) user name and password, 
an Amazon EC2 key pair, and a configured Virtual Private Cloud(VPC). 
Setting up to Host a Web App on AWS




Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
================================
In this step you will launch a virtual server to host Jenkins. These virtual instances are called EC2 instances. This is also called as Amazon Machine Image(AMI).
You will complete the following tasks:
*Create a Security Group for Your Amazon EC2 Instance
*Launch your EC2 Instance




Step 3 : Install and Configure Jenkins
=======================================
In this step you will deploy Jenkins on your EC2 instance by completing the following tasks:
*Connect to Your Linux Instance
*Download and Install Jenkins
*Configure Jenkins


Before doing the steps make sure you have java1.8 rather then default java1.7 ship with Amazon AMI. 
If you could see the 1.7 version you can uninstall and install the 1.8 using following commands,


$ sudo yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0



->Download and Install Jenkins
 1. To ensure that your software packages are up to date on your instance, use the following command to perform a quick software update:
 $ sudo yum update –y
 
 2. Add the Jenkins repo using the following command:
 $ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo
 
 3. Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package:
 $ sudo rpm — import http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key

 4. Install Jenkins:
 $ sudo yum install jenkins -y

 note:-Faced same problem while installing jenkins on aws ec2 instance. Below commands worked for me.

       $ sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
       $ sudo yum update -y
       $ sudo yum install jenkins java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y


 5. Start Jenkins as a service.
 Note : Before running the Jenkins, make sure your 8080 port is available or else you could run Jenkins on any other available port by simply changing the port inside the configuration file of CentOS rpm based linux i.e. /etc/sysconfig/jenkins file(The location in debian based linux is /var/default/jenkins), change the port as JENKINS_PORT=”8081”
 
 $ sudo service jenkins start #To start the jenkins service at boot-up, you can run,
 
 $ chkconfig jenkins on
 or
 $ systemctl start jenkins.service
 $ systemctl enable jenkins.service
 

Then, finally you could be able to visit your server IP or public DNS at the above port to get the jenkins dashboard by making sure that the port is open i.e. you added the inbould rule for that port on your AMI server. As, in my case the port is 8081, I’ll visit the following address, http://server-ip-address:8081/ You can see the below screen as you visited above URL,
Then you could visit the directory path shown in above image and get the initial password to proceed with the installation.
 
 $ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
 
and paste it in the page.
